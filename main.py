# TODO .... a lot
# 1. figure out how to use the api https://www.realestate.com.au/find-agency/graphql

# I write this inorder to help me to find all the property of meriton
# in this page: https://www.realestate.com.au/agency/meriton-sydney-MHDSYD?cid=nhbpp|rent:pdp:footer-overview
# I want to apply a filter to this webpage.

# I have tried to write a crawler for the api https://www.realestate.com.au/find-agency/graphql
# but it seems the cookies & post data a bit complicated.

# so I use burp to capture all the data and copy it. I only write the analyse part in agency_propety_parser.py.
